THINGS THAT AREN'T BUGS BUT MAYBE SHOULD BE FIXED:
It is too easy to accidentally click on the nagivation menu while playing set.

The password key-derivation is way too strong now. I don't want my server to be
100% loaded for half a second every time someone logs in.
---> To fix this we can have a flag for low-iteration derivation in the user
table. When new people register they automatically get a low-iteration
derivation. When someone who alreay has a high-iteration derivation logs in, we
replace it with a low-iteration derivation and set their flag.

OUTSTANDING BUGS:
If the cards start moving around before they are totally loaded, then they
can get stuck in the "removed" position.

BUGS THAT HAVE MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED ON THEIR OWN:
Sometimes we get the "Re(Start) Game" button mysteriously in the middle of a
game. No idea how to reproduce this one yet. Just fiddle around with it.

FIXED BUGS:
If a card is fading out and then it gets added to the board, I think it
continued fading out. So I need to kill any animations attached to cards
that we have put on the board.

Remove the outline around a card that gets removed.
